# TailwindKit

A Swift package that allows type safety when using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

## Why

This package allows the user of Tailwind CSS in Swift. There are use cases for writing HTML in Swift and that HTML needs to be styled. Tailwind CSS is a popular CSS framework that allows developers to easily add styles to the HTML element by specifying a class. Tailwind classes would be all strings in Swift, so this makes those strings type safe.
