# Contributing

Welcome! I'm glad you want to contribute! Tailwind is a big project and getting it converted over to Swift is a big process, so I'll take any help I can get!

There are some guidelines that I want to mention/

## Guidelines

- Commit messages *should* follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) as much as possible. This keeps the git commit history looking nice and clean.
- Keep Pull Requests under 600 changes
- Make sure to add to the [changelog](/CHANGELOG.md) and follow those [guidelines](./Changelog_Guidelines.md)
- Have fun!
